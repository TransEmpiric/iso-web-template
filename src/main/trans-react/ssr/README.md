# trans-react-ssr
> The Server Side Rendering (SSR)  module.

## This is the client or browser JavaScript module.

You can run `npm install`, `npm build`  or `npm run dev`.

## Installation

`Pleae make sure you have built the client app first.  The ssr app is dependent on the asset manifest file generated by the client build.`

### `How to run the production build`

```
cd iso-web-template/src/main/trans-react/ssr
npm install
npm run build

```
`You can now serve the client app and the ssr app via Spring Boot.`

```
cd ../../../../
./gradlew bootRun
```

### `How to run the development build`
`There is only one build atm.`

## Notes:
More documentation to come.
